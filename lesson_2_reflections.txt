1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a new file/folder .git, which tells the system, that it is now git repository and it should save the history and all the meta data of commits.
You need to do it, because a default folder do not track the history, so you need to tell the system that this folder should be tracked.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is the middle step from working directory to git repository. You choose the files that you want to commit and add them to the staging area. Maybe redundance?
